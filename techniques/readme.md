- Hopper: leader -> 5X -> dry fly -> 3X -> wet fly (5X can be tied onto existing 3X)
- Single nymph: leader -> 3X -> nymph (with indicator)
- Double nymph: leader -> 3X -> nymph -> 3X -> nymph (with indicator)
- Streamer: leader -> 3X -> streamer

## Euro Nymphing

## Tenkara Wet Flies

Use small black baetis, or other wet fly, with split shot relative to depth, and no indicator. Use 2 1/2 feet of 5X tippet tied on the end of the tenkara line - using a tippet ring - to the fly. The split shot is about a foot above the fly.

## Wet Wading

Use nylon pants to keep off the bugs & sun, worn with a pair of thin socks, wading socks, and rubber-soled wading boots.

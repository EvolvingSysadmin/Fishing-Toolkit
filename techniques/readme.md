## Casting

Follow these general tips when casting:

- Don't break wrist
- Keep the rod tip should go in a straight motion, it shouldn't angle down towards the water
- Always keep line under right hand when stripping

### Overhead Cast

- **Description**: Most common technique; useful in open areas
- **Technique**:
  - Lift the rod smoothly, pause, and cast forward with controlled force
  - Can pick up and lay down the line, false cast, and shoot line out
- **Keys**:
  - Use the right amount of line in the water; don't hold any stripped line in your left hand
  - Keep the line straight in the water
  - Start with a low rod tip
  - Pause on the backcast, don't break the wrist, and avoid casting too far forward
    - The tighter the arc of your hand, the tighter the loop will be
  - Keep the rod tall and straight for false casting, but don't false cast too much
  - To shoot line out: strip line first and release your finger when casting
  - Start with right foot forward

## Tips

### Targeting

- Target different areas of rivers by working the entire body of water

### Drifts

## Rigging

### General Rigging

- Dry fly: leader -> 5X -> dry fly (5X can be tied onto existing 3X)
- Hopper: leader -> 5X -> dry fly -> 3X -> wet fly (5X can be tied onto existing 3X)
- Single nymph: leader -> 3X -> nymph (with indicator)
- Double nymph: leader -> 3X -> nymph -> 3X -> nymph (with indicator)
- Streamer: leader -> 3X -> streamer

### Knots

- Full clinch for flies/lures
- Surgeons for leader to leader or droppers
- Perfection loop for Tenkara
- Use spit on knots to ensure they seat properly

### Dry Dropper Rigging

### Fly Selection

Use nylon pants to keep off the bugs & sun, worn with a pair of thin socks, wading socks, and rubber-soled wading boots.

- Pick up rocks to see what's underneath for fly selection
- Ducks typically mean hoppers
- Any trout in the world will eat a size 18 Pheasant Tail out of a river

Wet Flies:

Use small black baetis, or other wet fly, with split shot relative to depth, and no indicator. Use 2 1/2 feet of 5X tippet tied on the end of the tenkara line - using a tippet ring - to the fly. The split shot is about a foot above the fly.

## Casting

- Don't use too much wrist or break wrist while casting. The rod tip should go in a straight motion, it shouldn't angle down towards the water
- Always keep line under right hand when stripping

## Fly Selection

- Pick up rocks to see what's underneath for fly selection
- Ducks typically mean hoppers
- Any trout in the world will eat a size 18 Pheasant Tail out of a river

## Targeting

- Target different areas of rivers by working the entire body of water

## Rigging

### General Rigging

- Dry fly: leader -> 5X -> dry fly (5X can be tied onto existing 3X)
- Hopper: leader -> 5X -> dry fly -> 3X -> wet fly (5X can be tied onto existing 3X)
- Single nymph: leader -> 3X -> nymph (with indicator)
- Double nymph: leader -> 3X -> nymph -> 3X -> nymph (with indicator)
- Streamer: leader -> 3X -> streamer

### Tippet

### Knots

- Full clinch for flies/lures
- Surgeons for leader to leader or droppers
- Perfection loop for Tenkara
- Use spit on knots to ensure they seat properly

## Specific Techniques

### Euro Nymphing

### Tenkara

Wet Flies:

Use small black baetis, or other wet fly, with split shot relative to depth, and no indicator. Use 2 1/2 feet of 5X tippet tied on the end of the tenkara line - using a tippet ring - to the fly. The split shot is about a foot above the fly.

## Wet Wading

Use nylon pants to keep off the bugs & sun, worn with a pair of thin socks, wading socks, and rubber-soled wading boots.

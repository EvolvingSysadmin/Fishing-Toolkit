  - The creek starts at the top of Tioga Pass and travels through a steep canyon with plunge pools and pocket water
  - A number of lakes control it’s flow, particularly Ellery Lake
  - Water flows back into the creek below the power plant and flows through wooded section at Big Ben and Aspen campground until it enters a meadow section below Aspen Campground
  - The creek has a number of deep pools that provide protection for the resident trout.Within the meadow sections, use dry flies with fine tippets
  - There are good hatches of Blue Wing Olives in the early and late season
  - During the Summer, Pale Morning Duns and Gnats are a good choice. Within the deeper pools, use weighted nymphs in the size of #14-18. Streamers such as Wooly Buggers and Dace can get some good takes as well.

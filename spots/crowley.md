## Tips

- Fish can be at depths from the surface to about 12 feet; choose the sinking line accordingly
- Use sinking lines with 2x to 3x tippets for streamers
- Use floating lines with a 9-foot leader and indicator for nymphs and midges, with a 5x or 6x tippet
- 5wt to 7wt rod is recommended
- As for finding fish the old-fashioned way, look for shelves and structure in the shallower water at the start of the season, then look for cold water coming into the lake

## Techniques

- Fly fishing at Crowley Lake often uses Chironomid-type midges, such as Zebra midge, with an indicator at 8-11 feet depth
- Local guides developed a technique using a 2-3 midge rig with midges like Disco or Zebra, sizes 14-22, spaced 6 inches apart, fished about 6 inches from the bottom
- Use a hemostat on the dropper fly to determine proper depth and adjust the indicator accordingly
- Guides often use a larva imitation as the dropper with a bead head pupa on top
- During full hatches, switch to a bead-head pupa for the dropper and a bead head emerger on top
- If one fly is getting hits, use both of the same type
- A strike indicator helps control depth and indicate strikes
- No movement is applied to the fly, as movement deters trout from striking the midge
- A split shot 12 inches above the top fly helps maintain leader tension
- Many guides use an 8-foot 3X Fluorocarbon leader with a 12-inch 4X or 5X Fluorocarbon tippet for faster sinking and more invisible connection
- Bugger or leech patterns trailed by a Beaded Nymph like a Prince Nymph work well for trolling/stripping.
- During mid-summer, trout chasing perch fry respond well to streamer patterns like the Hornberg and Mohair Leech

## Seasons

- **Season Dates**
  - Season opens the last Saturday in April until November 15th
  - Must use artificial flies or lures from August 1st to November 15th
- **Early Season (Spring)**
  - Fish congregate around the mouth of the Owens River, Layton Springs, and Sandy Point for spawning
  - Spring warms up the water early, attracting trout
- **Mid-June**
  - Lake gets better from may through summer
  - Lake turnover occurs, making flyfishing difficult due to increased algae and undeveloped weedbeds
  - McGee Bay is a good option due to oxygenated water near the creek inlet
  - Trout seek areas where creeks enter the lake (McGee, Crooked Creek, Hilton Bay)
- **June and July**
  - Damsel hatch occurs; stillwater nymphing with Damsel Nymph patterns can be rewarding
  - Use imitations of damsel nymphs (#10-14) with a light to moderate sink tip or floating line
  - Fish the nymphs with rapid movements, allowing pauses for grabs
- **July**
  - Weed beds form up to 14 feet deep; fish reside within weedbed channels
  - Water clarity improves as algae abates.
  - Productive patterns: Buggers, Hornbergs, Damselfly Nymphs
  - Prime areas: Layton Springs, Green Banks, McGee Bay
- **Late July to September**
  - Weedbeds die off due to water draw-down
  - Possible regrowth of algae in August as water temperature drops
  - Fish found in 10-14 feet of water in oxygenated areas (Leighton Springs, McGee Bay)
  - Chironomid hatches are the main food source
  - September is the best month: trout chase perch fry due to lack of cover
  - Use Hornbergs and Buggers with intermediate line fishing 5-10 feet
  - Consistent location: McGee Bay, Green Banks
- **Mid-September**
  - Crowley Lake hosts the "Double-Haul" Tournament; fishing impact lasts a week or two
- **October**
  - Fish stage up along Green Banks and Leighton Springs for fall spawning
  - Best patterns: Streamer patterns, Stillwater Nymphs
- **Late October**
  - Water level lowering by L.A. City affects the fish
  - Colder temperatures reduce Chironomid hatches
  - Crowley closes to fishing on November 15th

# East Walker River

Bottom of dam outlet where river crosses 182

Use wading staff

- Mike is fishing a 10-foot, 4-weight here. This is a great rod for fishing the Miracle Mile under an indicator. The most effective technique here is to quickly stack mend your line after your first initial cast to allow your weighted flies to drop down into the zone quickly. I wouldn’t fish a rod any lighter than this on the EW. 3X to 5X tippet depending on time of year and water clarity. If you’re going to high stick this section, an 11-foot, 5-weight switch rod will do the trick.

- If I could take only four dries to the East Walker, they’d be an Elk Hair Caddis, EC Caddis, PMD, and Callibaetis Cripple. All in the 16/18 size range.

- I’ve done some damage here with Rubber Legs. It’s great pocket water. I might fish a Prince Nymph under a Rubber Legs under enough shot to get it all down. High stick heaven.

- Rosaschi Ranch is public access fishing located off the highway. To get there, head into Nevada and make a right on the dirt road that points to Hawthorne. I like to drive to the bridge.

Also fish the elbow

I also like fishing Robinson Creek a few miles southwest of Bridgeport - along Twin Lakes Road.

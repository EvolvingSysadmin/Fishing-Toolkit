## Spots

- **Hot Creek**
  - Upper Hot Creek near the interpretive site, west of Hot Creek Ranch
  - Target different areas of rivers by working the entire body of water
  - Hot creek canyon is below the ranch and above the interpretive center
  - Pick up rocks to see what's underneath for fly selection
  - Upper canyon = above the first parking lot
- **Upper Owens**
  - Fish where Owens River Road crosses the Owens River
  - Use western rods on upper Owens
  - Wet wade in the summer
  - Use 5X tippet. Vary split shot size based on water depth: larger for deep pools, smaller for bankside drifts. Dress dries with floatant and lead them downstream with the tippet

  - Shuttle from Mammoth Mountain Main lodge is a good way to fish the river
  - Starkweather or Sotcher lakes
  - The section near Devil's Postpile fishes well
  - Hike above Soda Springs Campground

## Spots

- **Hot Creek Area Map**
  - [Hot Creek Area Map](/img/hot-creek.gif)
- **Interpretative Site**
  - Location: [Hot Creek Interpretative Site Location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VrShBe8kGvkRbxnh8)
    - A few hundred yards of public access between the hatchery and the ranch
    - has a gazebo with signage of the fish and the water
    - You can fish this section up to the Hot Creek Ranch fenceline
  - Tips:
    - Some deep holes and ripple water stacked with trout
    - Good dry fly fishing during a hatch but wet flies can be more effective depending on the insect life
    - Fish are very weary of presentation throughout Hot Creek
    - The best time of the year to fish Hot Creek is the early summer when there is plenty of runoff and the hatches are active
- **Hot Creek Ranch**
  - Location: [Hot Creek Ranch Location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PZPjBc9EtZ4gcRv47)
  - [Hot Creek Ranch Website](https://www.hotcreekranch.com/)
  - 300 acres of private water between the Interpretative Site and the Canyon
  - Traditionalist dry fly with little pressure, but private
  - Books up months in advance
- **Hot Creek Canyon**
  - Locations:
    - [Hot Creek Canyon Parking Lot 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YCp3AdJj4s3EksLv9)
    - [Hot Creek Canyon Parking Lot 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ay37xh65oARYU88t6)
    - [Hot Creek Geologic Site](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4nHNkrjrsdUjZsAh9)
    - Below the Ranch and above the geothermally active area
    - Section at first parking lot is narrower than the top
    - Middle section between the two parking lots can be fun:
      - Use hoppers/caddis and target the far bank
    - Lower part of the canyon is very technical with skinny water and hesitant fish
    - Very bottom part of Hot Creek is fun with deep pools at the top with large fish
  - Tips:
    - Use same wet and dry flies used at the Interpretative Site
    - Pick up rocks to see what's underneath
    - Section has fresh water shrimp, so scuds can work well
    - Using small bobbers (eg just white material) works for fishing nymphs/wets
    - The top part of the canyon is great during summer, there is room to spread out

## Flies

- **Seasonal Flies**
  - Use caddis and be creative, mixing it up with mayflys, gnats, tricos, midges, etc...
    - Use wet flies at hot creek interpretive center
    - Mostly wet flies like scuds at Hot Creek Canyon
  - Caddis hatches throughout the season, especially in the early summer:
    - #16-20 dries
    - #18-20 emergers
    - #18-20 green larvae
  - In late summer (August/September), weeds choke off Hot Creek, but Trico spinners (#18-26) work well in the morning, with small Caddis patterns in the afternoon
    - Small hoppers and terrestrials are also effective in late summer
  - In Fall/Winter:
    - October: Dry fly season resumes with Fall Baetis hatches
    - Winter: Midges and Blue Wing Olives are the main hatches
  - Tackle:
    - Use a 7.5 ft, 5X leader, and 6X tippet
    - Drift a beadhead nymph through deeper sections or between weeds
